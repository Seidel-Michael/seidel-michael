Hi there! I’m Michael.

I’m a Full Stack Software Developer, Software Architect, DevOps Engineer, Scrum Master, Event Technician, Student, Tinkerer, Leader, Musician, Hiker, Cyclist, Climber, Brewer, …

I probably should consider myself lucky for the opportunity to contribute a lot of the things I love to my workplace and volunteering work.

My Mission is to use my skills to create a meaningful impact in the world. It is not enough to make stuff more efficient. We also must rethink old concepts all over. The answer to more efficient work is not working more but using the gained time for more meaningful things. There is more to life than work. The answer to climate protection is not just making more efficient cars, instead, we must change the way we think about individual mobility. Instead of buying new stuff, we must reduce waste and repair old stuff.

I would love to be part of world-changing projects to leave the world in a better state for coming generations and equip and mentor people to become world changers themselves.

Does sound idealistic? Might be. But I think we all agree that we cannot just continue as we do forever
